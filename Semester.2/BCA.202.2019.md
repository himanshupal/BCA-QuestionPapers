1. (a) Explain duality conditional and in-conditional statements.<br>
(b) Explain conditional and bi-condional operators, with an example.

***

2. Simplify the following Boolean function :<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F (A,B,C,D) = <img src="../expressions/Sigma.png" height="12px"> (0,1,2,8,9,10)**<br>

3. (a) Define the terms with respect to graph : Graph, path, cycle, tree, distance.<br>
(b) What is the shortest path problem ? Write down the Dijkstra's algorithm.

***

4. (a) Consider A = B = C = R and Let _f_ : A <img src="../expressions/isTo.png" height="10px"> B and _g_ : B <img src="../expressions/isTo.png" height="11px"> C be defined by _f(x) = x + 9_ and _g(y) = y<sup>2</sup> + 3_. Find the following composition function :<br>
